## Database
Database is a collection of data. It is a place where you can store and retrieve data from.

## Database Management System (DBMS)
DBMS is a software that is used to manage the database. It is a software that interacts with the user, applications and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. It is a software that allows creation, definition and manipulation of database.

## Types of DBMS
1. Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
2. NoSQL Database Management System (NoSQL DBMS)

## Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)

### What is RDBMS?
RDBMS is a software that stores data in the form of tables, which have rows and columns. It is based on the relational model. It is a collection of related tables. It is a software system that manages the relational database. It is a software that is used to create, manage and organize the relational database. It is a software that is used to store, update and retrieve data in a relational database.

### What is NoSQL DBMS?
NoSQL DBMS is a software that stores data in the form of documents, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. It is not based on the relational model. It is a collection of related documents, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. It is a software system that manages the NoSQL database. It is a software that is used to create, manage and organize the NoSQL database. It is a software that is used to store, update and retrieve data in a NoSQL database.

## What is a relational database?
A relational database is a database that stores data in tables that are related to each other. It is a collection of related tables. It is a collection of tables that are related to each other. I

## What is a table?
It is a collection of rows and columns that are related to each other in a structured format. 

## Data Modeling
Data modeling is the process of creating a data model for the data to be stored in a database. It is a process of creating a data model for the data to be stored in a relational database or a NoSQL database.

## Entity
An entity are the objects or things that we want to store data about.

## Attributes
Attributes are the properties of the entity. Columns are used to represent the attributes of the entity.

## Normalization
Normalization is the process of organizing the data in the database. Normalization is used to minimize the redundancy from a relation or set of relations. It is also used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies. Normalization divides the larger table into smaller and links them using relationships. The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.

### Types of Normalization
1. First Normal Form (1NF)
2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
5. Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
6. Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

### First Normal Form (1NF)
1. Each table cell should contain a single value.
2. Each record needs to be unique.
3. Each column should have a unique name.
4. The order in which data is stored does not matter.

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
1. It should be in the first normal form.
2. It should not have any partial dependency.
3. It should have a composite key.

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
1. It should be in the second normal form.
2. It should not have any transitive dependency.

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
1. It should be in the third normal form.
2. For every functional dependency (X â†’ Y), X should be a super key.

### Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
1. It should be in the Boyce-Codd normal form.
2. It should not have any multi-valued dependency.

### Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
1. It should be in the fourth normal form.
2. It should not have any join dependency and constraint dependency.

## Keys
Keys are used to uniquely identify a record in the table.

### Types of Keys
1. Super Key
2. Candidate Key
3. Primary Key
4. Alternate Key
5. Foreign Key
6. Composite Key
7. Surrogate Key
8. Natural Key

### Super Key


## SQL

SQL - > Structured Query Language
About SQL   => SQL is a standard language for accessing and manipulating databases. SQL was developed in the 1970s at IBM by Donald D. Chamberlin and Raymond F. Boyce. 
Not a database, but a language to access database.
Not a programming language, but a query language.
