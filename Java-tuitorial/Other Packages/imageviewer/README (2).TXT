     Assignment 3:				ImageViewer 2000

Author: M. Kölling
Version: 1.0 (20.09.2000)

USE:
To use this project, create a MonashImage object. Then inspect the image
object (using the "Inspect" operation from the popup menu) and select
the "MonashImage" tab in the inspector. Then you can invoke and observe 
other image operations.

DESCRIPTION:
This is the base version of CPE 1001's third assignment. The task is
to implement an image format that has some interesting image manipulation
operations (see assignment handout).

The class for the image has already been created. It is called "MonashImage".
In the base version, you can create an empty image or load an image from a 
gif file. One image operation ("darker()") has been implemented to give you
a starting point.

All your work is expected to be done in the class "MonashImage". You do not 
need to modify the classes "ImageReader".

Update this project comment before submitting the assignment.
