Check HDFS storage health
    - We can check the health (such as status, number of blocks, number of under replicated  blocks, replication factor, corrupt blocks and so on) on our Hadoop cluster usinf CLI
    - We can access out cluster details using Web Browser
    - We can get the complete history of all the jobs executed on the cluster (user user basis) using Web Browser
Access the web interface and know more about the cluster
