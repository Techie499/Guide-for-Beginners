## [NumPy](NumPy.ipynb)

In Python, everything is an object, which means that even simple ints are also objects, with all the required machinery to make object work. We call them "Boxed Ints". In contrast, NumPy uses primitive numeric types (floats, ints) which makes storing and computation efficient. NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices. 
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely. 

### Installation of NumPy

!pip install numpy

### Import NumPy

from numpy import *
or 
import numpy as np

### Creating NumPy Arrays

#### 1D Array

arr = np.array([1,2,3,4,5])

#### 2D Array

arr = np.array([[1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10]])

        ]
    )

## [Pandas](Pandas.ipynb)

Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008. It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables.

### Installation of Pandas

!pip install pandas

### Import Pandas

import pandas as pd

### Pandas Series

A Pandas Series is like a column in a table. It is a one-dimensional array holding data of any type.
