'We used this sub to see how you can use intellisense lists to quickly
'peruse properties and methods of many objects. For example, to see the
'difference between Workbook objects and Window objects you could type,
'either of these and a dot, to view the resulting list...

'ActiveWorkbook.[Prop and Method List]

'or

'ActiveWindow.[Prop and Method List]

'To see a more detailed description of any property or method, you can
'select it from the list and press the F1 key to bring up the VBA help
'description.

'This is a very useful manuever, and you will find that using F1 for
'context-sensitive help can make you a much more efficient programmer
'and problem-solver.

'Note that you can also use F1 to quickly access help for any item you
'have selected in the Object Browser.
