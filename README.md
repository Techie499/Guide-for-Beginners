## Big Data

### Hadoop
- [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) is an open-source software framework for storing data and running applications on clusters of commodity hardware. It provides massive storage for any kind of data, enormous processing power and the ability to handle virtually limitless concurrent tasks or jobs.

### Spark
- [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) is an open-source distributed general-purpose cluster-computing framework. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance.

## Python
- Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.

## DBMS (Database Management System) (SQL or NoSQL)
- A database management system (DBMS) is a software package designed to define, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in a database. A DBMS generally manipulates the data itself, the data format, field names, record structure and file structure. It also defines rules to validate and manipulate this data.

### SQL (Structured Query Language)
- [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) is a standard language for storing, manipulating and retrieving data in databases. Our SQL tutorial will teach you how to use SQL in: MySQL, SQL Server, MS Access, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, Postgres, and other database systems.

### NoSQL (Not only SQL)
- [NoSQL](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained) databases are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables. These databases are schema-free, support easy replication, have simple API, eventually consistent, and can handle huge amounts of data.

## Data Warehousing
- [Data Warehousing](https://www.talend.com/resources/what-is-data-warehousing/) is the process of compiling information into a data warehouse. A data warehouse is a database used to store data. The data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make better-informed decisions.
