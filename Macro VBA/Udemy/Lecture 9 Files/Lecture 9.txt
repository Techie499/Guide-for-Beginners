'The macros in this module are designed to illustrate some of the handy
'Range properties which give you access to a modified range, based on the
'original range. It is best to step through each of these while viewing
'the code and workbook window simultaneously. Use the F8 key to initiate
'step mode (or Debug/Step Into) then press F8 again to execute each
'subsequent line

'with no parameters to refer to the entire worksheet range
